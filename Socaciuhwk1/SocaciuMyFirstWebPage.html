  	 	<p>I'm enrolled in this class to learn HTML5 because I've only focused on 		   
	      	 backend programming thus far. Fun Fact, I mainly program in Java and C++. 
                          	 I believe that learning how to code in the frontend and backend           
	       	 will vastly increase the number of programming/developer jobs you'll           
                          	 be able to apply for and actually work in.</p>
